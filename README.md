Algorithmic Problem Solving Strategies Solutions with using Haskell and Rust

This sources is solution of problems in this [book](https://book.algospot.com) (author Jongman Koo, scripted in Korean)

These sources are made of Rust and Haskell (actually they're converted from C codes in the book).

I've tried to code in functional style but it's incomplete. 

So please feel free to feedback to suggest the better guide or other things about code.
